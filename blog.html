				<h3>Further Developing Hogwarts Assignment</h3>
                <h4>04/04/2023</h4>
				<p>I am furthering my development of the Hogwarts assignment by elaborating the user interface. It has been a slog of a marathon implementing the cursor designs and making it look as fun as possible. 
                    <br><br>The one issue I am having is trying to style the dropdown menu without having the dropdown behave conventionally</p>

				<p>I recentyl completed the portfolio assignment. This was my first attempt to create a webpage for the purposes of sending off to potential companies for internships. 
                    <br><br> For this assignment, I wanted to impress the companies by implementing fade in transitions by utilising time delay functions</p>

				<h3>Worked out my issue with uploading my portfolio project</h3>
                <h4>19/03/2023</h4>
				<p>After struggling with uploading the vite project on Github pages as well as my own domain, I researched how I could uplaod my project to surge and that seemed to solve the problem. 
                    <br><br> I had used surge whilst studying computer science so it was reasonably familiar but I was unaware of how to implement surge in my IDE. 
                    <br><br> I followed an easy tutorial online on how to install surge in my terminal (in a similiar fashion to vite) and my landing page worked perfectly. There are some issues on getting the images to look perfect on ios devices as well as android devices. I will look further into this issue

				<h3>Started to create a Vite Application</h3>
                <h4>19/03/2023</h4>
				<p>After making the portfolio, I now wish to explore making a website more responsive and create a site selling my skillset more. 
                    <br><br>After browsing YouTube videos, I encoutered a super nice video from a Youtuber who goes by the name of "Net ninja" who suggested I used vite to create a web page.</p> <img src="./images/vite.png" width="10%"alt=""> <br><br>

				<h3>Finally Cleaned Hogwarts</h3>
                <h4>15/03/2023</h4>
				<p>I finally managed to clean the Hogwarts data up. However, there were some issues regarding the data manipulation because I solved the problems in the assignment by creating an object array
                    <br> <br>
                    When it comes to creating the Hacking Hogwarts project, I really have to do some reading up on json manipulation.

				<p>This assignment gave me knowledge in the area of using javascript to select specefic pieces of data and give it a status of some kind. 
                    <br><br>In this assigment, I required to give specefic animals in the database the rank of winner. This will no doubt be useful in helping me with the hogwarts assignment when it comes to assigning students the rank of prefect.</p>
