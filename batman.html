        <h2>I love Batman but why is two better than one?</h2>
        <p>As a child of the 1980s, the memories of watching Tim Burtons Batman one christmas will always be moments to cherish. 
            I love how the gothic weird and wonderful world in which Tim Burton created set the tone for what Batman would look like
            not only on the big screen but also the small screen. What would transpire would be an animated series dedicated to the art 
            deco film noir style, the mesmorising 1992 film Batman Returns and a Danny Elfman score which screams nostaliga on every 
            listening opportunity. Putting on Batman 1989 or Batman 1992 onto my television just feels like putting on a vinyl record. 
            I have a similiar feeling with the 1992 animated series (which ended up being so good, it ended up creating an animated expanded
            universe similiar to what we see in Hollywood today). <br><br>
            Of course most filmgoers know that the series went down a contraversial shift in tone allowing the following films to become 
            much more family friendly starting with Batman Forever in 1995. This decision inevitably led to the criticism family audineces had 
            with Danny Devitos fantasticall grotesque portrayal of the joker. After Burton left any associations with the films over to 
            Joel Scheumacher, the films became camp, tacky and out of fashion for many years until Chris Nolan made Batman begins in 2005. <br><br>
            So what happened after 2005? Batman became popular again. A few years down the line, Chris Nolan made the Dark Knight, a true marvel in 
            superhero storytelling which left the door open to create one final film in a Batman Trilogy many would say tops the efforts of Burton 
            in the late 80s, early nineties. No matter what audience member you were, wether you loved or hated superhero media, Batman was always 
            a character audiences would invest their time in.     
        </p>
        <p>As Marvel were putting together their own interconnected movies to create the MCU, it was only a matter of time until DC tried to do the same.
            There have always been rumours that DC always wanted to bring aspects of magic and wonder to their films in the same way that Marvel did with
            films such as Doctor Strange (2016 )or Thor (2011) but felt as though films portraying the fantastical side of DC like Rais Al'Gul staying alive
            for centuries by batheing in a pool called "the lazarus pit", introducing characters like Etrigan the Demon and even characters like Robin and
            Batgirl have always been directions DC have tried to stay away from for decades. <br><br>
            Some of those decisions are down to executives not confident that those stories would work on the big screen. With the success of Marvel However, 
            DC attempted to bring back properties such as Superman, Wonderwoman, Aquaman with some moderate success.

          <figcaption>It was a weird reaction to 'Batman Returns,' because half the people thought it was lighter than the first one, and half the people 
            thought it was darker. I think the studio just thought it was too weird - they wanted to go with something more child- or family-friendly. 
            In other words, they didn't want me to do another one. <br><br> Tim Burton 2014</figcaption>

        <h3>James Gunn and David Zaslav</h3>
        <p>After the poor reception of many DCEU films such as Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, Justice League, Black Adam and Shazam: Fury of Gods, 
            this has encouraged DC to start the story from scratch and start a whole new slate of films focusing on a completely seperate continuity. 
            With this decision came the desire to keep Robert Pattinsion as the Batman and hire another Batman to be the face of DC's newest interconnected
            "DCU". <br><br>
            This could ultimately lead to all audiences getting exactly what they want. This could introduce Batman into the world of magic, allow him to 
            interact with Doctor Fate (DC's equivalent to Doctor Strange), have Robin as a sidekick and ignore the inconsistencies of Robin keeping his 
            identity secret with just that small mask on his face. This would then give room for Matt Reeves "The Batman" film series to remain engrained
            in the real world and not rely on incorporating characters with superhuman abilities. <br><br>
            I always found that there was always the capacity to have Superman or any superhero to exist in previous iconic Batman films but there was 
            little interest in the directors and the executives. However, this could change and I do find that exciting
        </p>
        <blockquote>For me, Batman is the one that can most clearly be taken seriously. He's not from another planet, or filled with radioactive gunk. 
            I mean, Superman is essentially a god, but Batman is more like Hercules: he's a human being, very flawed, and bridges the divide.<br><br> Chris Nolan, 2005</blockquote>
        <p>Despite DC's poor box office figures and reputation over the last 10 years, they do have an interesting opportunity to reignite the superhero
            franchise which seems to be in dispute due to recent comic movie fans reaction to previous films. <br><br>
        It does beg the question how long the Superhero movie genre has. Will it prosper for decades to come or will it go out of fashion in the same way 
    that the western genre went and go into obscurity? Only time will tell</p>
